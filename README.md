This project aims to predict housing prices in Boston using machine learning techniques. It utilizes the Boston Housing Dataset, which includes various features such as crime rate, number of rooms, property tax, and more.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Dataset: The dataset consists of 506 samples with 13 features describing different aspects of housing in Boston.
Goal: Build a regression model to predict the median house price.
Tech Stack: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
ðŸ“Š Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following features:

Feature	Description
CRIM:	Per capita crime rate by town
ZN:	Proportion of residential land zoned for large lots
INDUS:	Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
CHAS:	Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river, 0 otherwise)
NOX:	Nitrogen oxide concentration (parts per 10 million)
RM:	Average number of rooms per dwelling
AGE:	Proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940
DIS:	Weighted distance to employment centers
RAD:	Accessibility to radial highways
TAX:	Property tax rate per $10,000
PTRATIO:	Pupil-teacher ratio by town
B:	Proportion of Black residents
LSTAT:	Percentage of lower status population
MEDV:	Median value of owner-occupied homes (target variable)
